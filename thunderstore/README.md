# Nine Sols Cutscene Skip

A Nine Sols mod that enables skipping any cutscene or dialogue (that won't break the game), as well as undoing forced slow walks.

This should cover all of the game's longest cutscenes (Heng flashbacks, the prison capture sequence, the Point of no Return scenes, all conversations and phone calls) as well as many smaller ones that are safe to skip (some boss transitions, most of the Pavilion NPC interactions, etc). However, many smaller cutscenes (e.g. some Yi elevator rides) are deliberately not made skippable because trying to skip them would break the game in some way (e.g. leave Yi stuck in a wall).

Whenever the mod detects something it knows how to skip safely (or a 'story walk' it can undo), it will display a notification in the bottom right corner prompting you to skip. The keybinds for actually skipping/undoing can also be changed. If you're new to Nine Sols mods: install the BepinExConfigurationManager mod and press F1 in-game to change settings like that.

As a demonstration, this is what it looks like to skip the Point of no Return cutscenes:

If you find a way to break the game with this mod, please open an issue on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ixrec/NineSolsCutsceneSkip).
